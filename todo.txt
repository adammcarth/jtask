Current List To Transition From Beta Into Stable:

1. Setup a dynamic method handler to make the JTask.get()
method cleaner when selecting hash elements.

Eg - JTask.get("email_subscribers", 5).email

For more information, see ActiveRecord's implementation of method_missing().

2. Add an encryption feature?

3. Allow users to set the default directory.

4. Clean up repeated code!!!

5. Make file writes more efficient (to prevent scaling issues). Currently, files are completely re-written with the new version on save(), update(), chop() and destroy().

6. Change hash outputs to openstructs.
